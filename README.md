# Lab-2
Gray Area

This lab writes code which measures the motion of a motor which has an incremental encoder attached. 

Ecoder Read Class

>>> We wrote a class called Encoder that ecapsulates the operation of the timer to read encoders. 

>>> The encoder class is stored in a file called encoder_reader.py

Testing

>>> we tested our encoder class by first turning the motor by hand and then by running the motor under power. 

>>> Our code returns
