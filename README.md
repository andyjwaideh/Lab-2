# Lab-2 Gray Area

Encoders

    During this portion of the lab where we where able to connecting the 
    encoders to power and ground, to then use the oscilloscope to verify
    quadrate signals, in out case this was Channels A and B, from the encoder.
Encoder Reading Procedure
    
    While moving the encoder channels A and B onto the Nucleo board, we where
    then able to write code to set up timer and counters in the encoder counting
    mode for both set of encoder pins. Ensure that your code works by manual
    rotating the motor.
    
Encoder Reader Class

    We where then able to develop a call 'Encoder' giving a summary of encoder
    reading operation to locate position of motor. By implementing '__init__()'
    , 'read()', and "zero().
    
Testing

    To test the encoder, we had to ensure that we tested the motor under various
    conditions, including manual motor rotation and power powered motor operation.
    Testing to see that we are able to read the motor postion under all conditons.
